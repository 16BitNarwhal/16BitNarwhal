## 📖 About Me
I'm a first-year student studying 💻 Software Engineering at the 🏫 University of Waterloo! 

I'm incredibly interested in 🤖 Machine Learning and I also love building out random 💡 ideas!

I also like to 🎹 play piano, 🪨 rock climb and 🥋 train taekwondo (psst! go check out my [fitness instagram](https://www.instagram.com/16fitnarwhal/))!

## 🌱 Currently...
I’m currently working on [ScoreSwipe](https://github.com/16BitNarwhal/ScoreSwipe), a mobile app for helping musicians flip digital music sheets. I'm learning Flutter and Dart programming along with the Business Logic Component architecture in order to do this!
